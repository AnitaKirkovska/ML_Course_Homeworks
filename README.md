# ML_Course_Homeworks 

``` This repository consists of materials, resources, examples, code workshops and homeworks that we did as part of the Machine Learning course in UCF in Spring 2019.```

# Resources used

## Neural Networks 

1. [Machine Learning course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/lecture/RKFpn/welcome) with Andrew Ng, Artificial Inteligence pioneer.
2. [Keras documentation](https://keras.io/)
3. [Numpy documentation](http://www.numpy.org/)
4. [Make your own Neural Network](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Your-Own-Neural-Network-ebook/dp/B01EER4Z4G). One of the best book to start with the material.


## Convolutonal Networks

1. [Begginers guide to Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks](https://adeshpande3.github.io/adeshpande3.github.io/A-Beginner's-Guide-To-Understanding-Convolutional-Neural-Networks/) by Adit Deshpande. Really useful to start with.
