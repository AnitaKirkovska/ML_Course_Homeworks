# Machine Learning Course Spring 2019, University of Central Florida 

``` This repository consists of materials, resources, examples, code workshops and homeworks that were useful for me as a beginner.```

# Resources used

## Tools
1. [Keras documentation](https://keras.io/)
2. [Numpy documentation](http://www.numpy.org/)
3. [Codelabs by Google](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/)

## Books

1. [Make your own Neural Network](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Your-Own-Neural-Network-ebook/dp/B01EER4Z4G). One of the best book to start with the material. If you are a begginer you will love this book. It takes on the simplest explanation and adds complexity to it until you finally are able to build your first NN.
2. [Deep Learning with Python](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python). Really good book! It is something that you want to start with after you finish with the first book, it covers practical examples and concept really thoroughly. 
3. [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) Free book, professors recommendation. Didn't have much luck with it.

## Free Courses and Materials

1. [Machine Learning course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/lecture/RKFpn/welcome) with Andrew Ng, Artificial Inteligence pioneer. FREE COURSE, really good content, and excellent projects.
2. [Begginers guide to Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks](https://adeshpande3.github.io/adeshpande3.github.io/A-Beginner's-Guide-To-Understanding-Convolutional-Neural-Networks/) by Adit Deshpande. Really useful to start with.
3. [Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognitions by Stanford](http://cs231n.github.io/) Only notes available.
4. [Visualizing and Understanding ConvNets](https://cs.nyu.edu/~fergus/papers/zeilerECCV2014.pdf) A research paper.
